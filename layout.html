      <h1>HANNIBAL - THE BATTLE OF CANNAE</h1>
      <p>It is primarily known for the Battle of Cannae, 
         in which the numerically superior Roman army suffered a disastrous 
         defeat by Hannibal in 216 BC (see Punic Wars). There is a considerable 
         controversy as to whether the battle took place on the right or the left 
         bank of the river. In later times the place became a municipium, 
         and remains of an  unimportant Roman town still exist upon the hill known 
         as Monte di Canne. In the Middle Ages, probably after the destruction of 
         Canosa di Puglia in the 9th century, it became a bishopric (see below), 
         and again saw military action in the second battle of Cannae, 
         twelve centuries after the more famous one (1018). 
         The town was wrecked in 1083 by Robert Guiscard, 
         who left only the cathedral and bishop's residence,[1] and 
         was ultimately destroyed in 1276.</p>
